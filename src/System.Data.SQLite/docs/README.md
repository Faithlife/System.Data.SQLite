# Inactive Project

This package is not actively maintained. We recommend using one of the following supported alternatives:

* [System.Data.SQLite.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SQLite.Core)
* [Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite)

# A lightweight cross-platform replacement for System.Data.SQLite

This is an independent implementation of the core of ADO.NET: `IDbConnection`, `IDbCommand`, `IDbDataReader`, `IDbTransaction` (plus a few helpers) â€” enough types to let you create and query SQLite databases from managed code, including support for libraries such as [Dapper](https://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/).

It supports the following platforms: .NET 4.5 (Any CPU), Xamarin.iOS, PCL, MonoTouch, MonoAndroid.
